I am a graduate student studying computational linguistics at [Tel-Aviv University](https://www.tau.ac.il) under the guidance of [Prof. Roni Katzir](https://english.tau.ac.il/profile/rkatzir), and part of the [TAU Computational Linguistics Lab](https://taucompling.github.io). My interest lies primarily in human cognition, specifically in understanding how humans learn languages and the computational models that underlie this process.

In addition to my studies, I am a software engineer at [Sentra](https://www.sentra.io), helping organizations in maintaining full visibility and control of data, while also safeguarding against sensitive data breaches across their cloud stack.
